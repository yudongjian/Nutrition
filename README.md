## Prerequisite Step 1

Before using this project, please download the pre-trained weight files:  你首先需要下载预训练的权重文件：

[Download CLIP, Swin-Transforemer, ConvNext, Point-Transformer here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i-AExbFDi4cLy_OPYUmGm_q5f8EITpjJ?usp=drive_link)

After downloading, place the files in the `pth/` and  `point-transformer/` folder of the project (create the folder if it doesn't exist).
[Download DINO-V2 here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov2-base/tree/main)

## Prerequisites Step 2

For training the 2D and 3D models, you need to set the paths to the pre-trained weights in advance. If you only want to use one model, you only need to set the corresponding pre-trained weight path.
对于2D 和 3D，你使用任何一个你就设置任何一个即可。
- **2D training**:  
  In `train2D-mm.py`, please configure the following paths:
  - `clip_path` (located at **line 81**).
  - `pth_path` (for **Swin-T** and **ConvNeXt** pre-trained weights) (located at **line 94**).
  In `model/three_D.py`, please set the path to the **DINO** pre-trained weights (located at **line 174**).
- **3D training**:  
  In `train2D-mm.py`, please configure the following paths:
  - `clip_path`  (located at **line 81**).
  - `pth_path` (for **Swin-T** and **ConvNeXt** pre-trained weights) (located at **line 94**).
  - `checkpoint` (for **Point Transformer** ) (located at **line 131**).
  In `model/three_D.py`, please set the path to the **DINO** pre-trained weights (located at **line 174**).



## 🚧 Code Release Notice
We recommend using the 2D-only version, as it runs significantly faster while still achieving competitive performance.
The 3D-enhanced version provides additional spatial cues but incurs higher computational cost.
2D 和 3D 任选一个即可， 这里推荐你选择2D, 因为开销会低一些。效果也很不错的。
```bash
# Train the model without 3D information (2D-only, recommended)
python train2D-mm.py --b 8 --log ./logs/log1  

or
# Train the model with 3D information
python train2D-mm.py --b 8 --log ./logs/log1
```
