## Prerequisite Step 1

Before using this project, please download the pre-trained weight files:  你首先需要下载预训练的权重文件：

[Download CLIP, Swin-Transforemer, ConvNext, Point-Transformer here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i-AExbFDi4cLy_OPYUmGm_q5f8EITpjJ?usp=drive_link)

After downloading, place the files in the `pth/` and  `point-transformer/` folder of the project (create the folder if it doesn't exist).
[Download DINO-V2 here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov2-base/tree/main)

## Prerequisites Step 2

For training the 3D models, you need to set the paths to the pre-trained weights in advance.  You need to set the corresponding pre-trained weight path.

- **3D training**:  
  In `train3D-mm.py`, please configure the following paths:
  - `clip_path`  
  - `pth_path` (for **Swin-T** and **ConvNeXt** pre-trained weights) 
  - `checkpoint` (for **Point Transformer** ) 
  In `model/three_D.py`, please set the path to the **DINO** pre-trained weights (located at **line 174**).
